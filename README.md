## Huddle Landing Page

> This responsive landing page was build from design provided by [frontmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0).
> Both mobile and desktop version were provided. The designs were in JPG static format. This means 
that I had to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.
